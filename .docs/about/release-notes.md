[Mathieu Velten](https://github.com/MatMaul) | Mr. Velten, as his people alert you to the fact that he insists on being addressed, is a dubious individual. It's apparent he's old money, but it's also not exactly clear from where his fortune originated. There are rumors in the back rooms of the shadiest gambling parlors of Monte Carlo that Mr. Velten was once an employee of an unnamed wing of a shadow government. A "cleaner" if you will. Maybe it was these experiences that make Mr. Velten so apt at slicing up Git commits. Is there really any difference between slicing up a full-grown man and hash series of changes? Mr. Velten is proof there isn't.
[Joe Topjian](https://github.com/jtopjian) | Joe insisted that we omit this pithy attempt at showing gratitude, but we simply could not do that. Not when Mr. Velten insisted it would be in our best interest to include Joe. Is this okay Mr. Velten? Can our families come home now? We did what you asked. Joe is awesome. We like Joe. See? We're cooperating. Please Mr. Velten, just let them come home!

[Chris Duchesne](https://github.com/cduchesne) | Chris is my partner in crime when it comes to libStorage and REX-Ray. Without him I would have absolutely no one to take the fall for the heist I'm planning. So is Chris invaluable? Yeah, in that way, as the patsy who will do at least a dime while I'm on the beach sipping my drink, yeah, he's invaluable.
[Travis Rhoden](https://github.com/codenrhoden) | Travis, or as I call him, T-Dawg, is essential to "taking care of business." He comes to work to chew bubblegum and kick butt, and he leaves the gum at home!
[Dan Norris](https://github.com/protochron) | Dan "The Man" Norris is well known in the underground street-swimming circuit. Last year he tied Michael Phelps in the Santa Monica Sewer 120 meter medley. He would have won if not for stopping to create the DigitalOcean driver for libStorage.
[Alexey Morlang](https://github.com/alexey-mr) | As a third-chair oboe player in the Moscow orchestra it is surprising that Alexey still finds time to contribute to the project, but coming from a long line of oboligarchs (oboe playing oligarchs), it's just in his nature. As is creating storage drivers. That, and, well, playing the oboe.
[Andrey Pavlov](https://github.com/Andrey-mp) | There is no Andrey. You have not met him. He does not exist. Don't look behind you. He is not there. He is writing storage drivers. Then just like that, he's vanished.
[Lax Kota](https://github.com/Lax77) | Lax is a rock star in the Slack channel, helping others by answering their questions before the project's developers can take a stab. We do not want to upset him. It's rumored he beats those who upset him in order to provide inspiration for his true passion -- corporal poetry. Every punch thrown is another verse towards his masterpiece.
[Jack Huang](https://github.com/jack-fittedcloud) | Jack is not his job. Jack is not the amount of money he has in the bank. Jack is not the car he drives. Jack is not the clothes he wears. Jack is a supernova, accelerating at the speed of light beyond the bounds of quantifiable space and time. Jack is not the stuff above. Jack is not the stuff below. Jack is not the stuff in between. Jack is not the empty void. Jack. just. is.

## Version 0.1.1 (2016/06/10)
This is the initial GA release of libStorage.

### Features
libStorage is an open source, platform agnostic, storage provisioning and
orchestration framework, model, and API. Features include:

- A standardized storage orchestration
  [model and API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io/)
- A lightweight, reference client implementation with a minimal dependency
  footprint
- The ability to embed both the libStorage client and server, creating native
  application integration opportunities

### Operations
`libStorage` supports the following operations:

Resource Type | Operation | Description
--------------|-----------|------------
Volume | List / Inspect | Get detailed information about one to many volumes
       | Create / Remote | Manage the volume lifecycle
       | Attach / Detach | Provision volumes to a client
       | Mount / Unmount | Make attached volumes ready-to-use, local file systems
Snapshot | | Coming soon
Storage Pool | | Coming soon

### Getting Started
Using libStorage can be broken down into several, distinct steps:

1. Configuring [libStorage](/user-guide/config.md)
2. Understanding the [API](http://docs.libstorage.apiary.io)
3. Identifying a production server and client implementation, such as
   [REX-Ray](https://rexray.rtfd.org)
